# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Renamed the repo to `Linkuistics/skills` and the plugin to `linkuistics`
  (namespace `linkuistics:`); added an Apache-2.0 licence.
- Initial release. Coding standards packaged as agent skills:
  - `coding-style` — universal principles (auto-loads on any file).
  - `coding-style-{rust,python,elixir,bash,swift,typescript}` — per-language
    style guides, auto-loading by file extension.
  - `cli-tool-design` — LLM-friendly CLI design guidance, with the audit
    checklist and refactoring sequence split into `references/`.
- Claude Code marketplace manifest (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`).
- `install.sh` for symlinking skills into Codex / Gemini CLI.
