# grove — materialised version

A materialised copy of the \`grove\` skill: plain files committed in this repo.
This file records where the copy came from and how to refresh it.

| | |
|---|---|
| grove source | \`Linkuistics/skills@${skills_sha}\` |
| bundled conventions | \`mattpocock/skills@${matt_sha}\` |
| materialised on | $(date +%Y-%m-%d) |
| materialised into | \`.claude/skills/grove/\` |

## Updating

From a \`Linkuistics/skills\` clone, checked out at the ref you want to pin:

\`\`\`
scripts/materialise-grove.sh <path-to-this-repo> [<ref>]
\`\`\`

Review the resulting diff and commit it. By discipline, record the bump in an
ADR (\`docs/adr/\`).
