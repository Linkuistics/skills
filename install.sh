# Claude Code does NOT need this script. Install there via the marketplace:
#   /plugin marketplace add Linkuistics/skills
#   /plugin install linkuistics@linkuistics
#
# For the harnesses below, the SKILL.md format is shared but there is no
# package manager, so symlinks are the install mechanism. Because the targets
# are symlinks, a later `git pull` in this repo updates the content in place —
# no need to re-run this script unless skills are added or removed.
